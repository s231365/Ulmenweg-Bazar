                        We are a group of students developing this web store as part of our university course of
                        Web Engineering. Our aim is to provide a seamless online shopping experience while learning and
                        applying our knowledge in web development. We believe in learning by doing, and this project is
                        a
                        testament to that belief. We hope you enjoy using our web store as much as we enjoyed building
                        it.
